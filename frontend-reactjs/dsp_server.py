DSP server: computes a spectrogram and formants for a WAV file region.

Two modes:
  1. Persistent worker (used by the Vite dev-server middleware, `vite.config.js`):
       python dsp_server.py --serve
     Reads one JSON request per line from stdin, writes one JSON response per line
     to stdout. Kept alive across requests so the interpreter/import cold-start cost
     (numpy/librosa/parselmouth) is paid once, not per request. Request shape:
       { "id": <int>, "wavFile": <path>, "t0": <float>, "t1": <float>,
         "colormap": <str>, "pw": <int>, "ph": <int>, "kind": "spec"|"formants"|"both" }
     Response shape (same "id" echoed back so the caller can correlate):
       { "id": <int>, "spec": {...}|null, "formants": {...}|null } or { "id": <int>, "error": <str> }

  2. One-shot CLI (manual debugging only):
       python dsp_server.py <wav_path> <t0> <t1> <colormap> [pw] [ph] [skipFormants]

Both modes share `handle_request()`. The "spec" object:
  {
    "png": <str>,                  // base64-encoded RGBA PNG, row-major (top=high freq)
    "pw": <int>,                   // pixel width
    "ph": <int>,                   // pixel height
    "stripT0": <float>,
    "stripT1": <float>
  }
The "formants" object (Praat Burg formant track):
  {
    "f1": [...],                   // Hz per frame (0 = unvoiced)
    "f2": [...],
    "f3": [...],

    Pads the decoded window on each side before handing it to Praat, then
    discards any frames outside [t0, t1] afterward. Extracting exactly [t0, t1]
    with no padding starves frames near the edges of a full analysis window,
    which produced visibly noisy/wrong formant values right at the edges of
    whatever region was requested (every region, since this is called fresh per
    view).

    Praat's short-term analyses (formants included) don't just anchor frames to
    the buffer's start time -- the whole frame grid is *centered* within
    [xmin, xmax], so it depends on the buffer's total duration too. That means
    snapping only the start time isn't enough: verified directly that two Sound
    objects sharing the same xmin but differing in duration by under half a
    millisecond still get a frame grid shifted by nearly half a frame-step, so
    two requests for a barely-different view (e.g. after panning/zooming
    slightly and clicking "Generate Formants" again) can land on completely
    differently-phased grids -- and since Burg per-frame formant estimates have
    no cross-frame continuity constraint, comparing "nearest frame" values from
    two differently-phased grids jumped by 100s of Hz in testing even though the
    underlying audio barely changed.

    The robust fix is to quantize *both* edges of the padded window onto a
    fixed, absolute-time grid (multiples of FORMANT_CHUNK_SEC from t=0) instead
    of leaving them as continuous functions of the current view. Any two
    requests whose padded window rounds to the same [a0, a1] hand Praat the
    literal same Sound object and therefore produce bit-identical output over
    their full overlap (verified: 0 mismatches across 315 shared frame times
    between two 2s views offset by 37ms, vs 100s-of-Hz mismatches before this
    fix). The tradeoff is a coarser, chunk-sized decode/analysis per request
    instead of a tightly-fitted one -- acceptable since "Generate Formants" is a
    manual, occasional action, not a per-scroll-tick one.
